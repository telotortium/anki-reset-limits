# Description

An Anki add-on that adds "Reset Limit Increases" to the bottom of each deck
overview screen, in order to reverse the effect of "Increase today's new card
limit" or "Increase today's review card limit" in Custom Study. Useful if
you've accidentally increased today's new card limit when you meant to raise
the review card limit.
